# Python Unittest and Integration Tests

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### 1. Difference between Unit and Integration Tests

#### Unit Tests:

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or units of code in isolation. The primary goal is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as designed. In Python, the `unittest` module provides a framework for creating and running unit tests. Key characteristics of unit tests include:

- **Isolation:** Units are tested in isolation, meaning dependencies are often replaced with mocks or stubs to isolate the code under test.
- **Granularity:** Tests are fine-grained, targeting small, specific functions, methods, or classes.
- **Speed:** Unit tests should be fast, allowing for quick feedback during development.

#### Integration Tests:

Integration tests, on the other hand, focus on verifying the interactions and interfaces between components. These tests ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected. Key aspects of integration tests include:

- **Interaction:** Multiple units or components are tested together to validate their interactions.
- **Scope:** Tests cover broader scenarios, checking how different parts integrate and function as a whole.
- **Real-world scenarios:** Integration tests often involve real dependencies, databases, APIs, etc., to simulate real-world usage.

Understanding when to use unit tests and when to use integration tests is crucial for effective testing strategies.

### 2. Common Testing Patterns

#### a. Mocking:

Mocking is a technique used in unit testing to replace real objects with simulated objects. This helps isolate the code under test by removing dependencies on external services or components. The `unittest.mock` module in Python provides tools for creating mock objects. Learning objectives for mocking include:

- **Creating Mocks:** Understand how to create mock objects to replace external dependencies.
- **Assertions:** Use assertions to verify that mock objects are called with the expected parameters and in the correct order.

#### b. Parametrization:

Parametrization allows running the same test logic with different inputs. This helps ensure that the code behaves correctly across various scenarios. In the `unittest` framework, parametrized tests can be achieved using the `@unittest.parameterized.parameterized` decorator. Learning objectives for parametrization include:

- **Decorators:** Understand how to use decorators to create parametrized tests.
- **Data-driven Testing:** Learn to structure test data for different test scenarios.

#### c. Fixtures:

Fixtures are a way to set up preconditions or context for tests. They provide a consistent and controlled environment for test execution. The `unittest` framework supports fixtures through the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods. Learning objectives for fixtures include:

- **Fixture Setup:** Learn to use the `setUp` method to set up preconditions before each test.
- **Fixture Teardown:** Understand the `tearDown` method for cleaning up resources after each test.

Mastering these testing patterns enhances your ability to write robust and maintainable test suites, improving the overall quality of your Python codebase.
